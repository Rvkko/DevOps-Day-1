# DevOps Day 1 Challenge

## Overview

The **DevOps Day 1 Challenge** is designed to get you up and running with the core tools and practices used in DevOps. This includes version control, continuous integration, containerization, and automationâ€”all key components of modern development workflows.

## Challenge Goals

- Set up version control with Git
- Implement Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines
- Containerize applications using Docker
- Automate key processes to save time and reduce manual work
- Understand the basics of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using tools like Terraform

## Tools & Technologies

- **Git**: Version control for managing code changes
- **CI Tools**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI for automating code integration and testing
- **Docker**: For containerizing applications and ensuring consistency across environments
- **Terraform**: To manage infrastructure through code, making it reproducible and scalable

## What I Learned

- **Version Control with Git**: Track changes and collaborate on code with ease
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically test and integrate code changes to improve quality and speed
- **Containerization with Docker**: Package and deploy applications in a consistent, portable way
- **Automation**: Automate manual tasks to reduce human error and improve workflow efficiency
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Begin automating infrastructure provisioning using code

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone <repo-url>

sql
Copy code
2. Set up your Git environment and start managing version control for your project.
3. Follow the steps to set up CI pipelines using your tool of choice (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions).
4. Dockerize your application to ensure it can run consistently across any environment.
5. Automate your deployment process and infrastructure setup using Terraform or your preferred IaC tool.

## Conclusion

By completing the **DevOps Day 1 Challenge**, you will have gained hands-on experience with foundational DevOps practices that will help streamline your development processes and foster collaboration between development and operations teams.
